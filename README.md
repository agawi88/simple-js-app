# simple-js-app

<h1>PokeDex Project</h1>

<b>Overview</b>
In this project I was tasked with developing a simple JavaScript web application that, via an external API, presents a list of pokemons and detailed information about each of them. Users can access detailed information about each pokemon by a list item which opens up the details in a modal. While developing this application I learned fundamental as well as some advanced JavaScript features. Furthermore, I learned how to implement and use libraries and frameworks. The framework implemented in this project is Bootstrap.

<b>Technologies Used</b>
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, APIs.

<b>Key themes covered</b>

<b>Future Enhancements</b>
Add more detailed Pok√©mon information: like abilities and a back image.
Implement a loading message to improver the perceived performance.
