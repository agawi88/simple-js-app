<h1>PokeDex JS App</h1>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>In this project I was tasked with developing a simple JavaScript web application that, via an external API, presents a list of pokemons and detailed information about each of them. Users can access detailed information about each pokemon by a list item which opens up the details in a modal. While developing this application I learned fundamental as well as some advanced JavaScript features. Furthermore, I learned how to implement and use libraries and frameworks. The framework implemented in this project is Bootstrap.</p>
